This outlines how to propose a change to the Save the Earth project.

### Fixing typos

Minor grammatical errors or typos in the documentation can be directly corrected using
the GitHub web interface, but ensure you make the changes in the _source_ file.

### Prerequisites

Before making a significant pull request, it's important to first raise an issue and
ensure someone from the team acknowledges it as a problem. If you've discovered a
bug, create a related issue and demonstrate the bug with precise language.

*  Adding Assignee: Please assign the issue to the main contributors if you know who to assign, otherwise, feel free to leave it blank.
