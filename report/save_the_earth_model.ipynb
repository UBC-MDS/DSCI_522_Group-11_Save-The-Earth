    "Here we attempt to build a prediction model using the k-nearest neighbours algorithm which can use energy consumption and energy generation measurements to predict CO2 emission of certain country of next year. Our final prediction model perform pretty well on unseen test dataset, with $\\text{R}^2$ of 0.975 and an overall accuracy calculated to be 0.976. However, the model predict CO2 emission by finding the existing cases in the training data set which is most similiar to unseen data, thus, if there is a case in unseen data set of which measurements are beyond the ranges in training data set (ie. massive increase of energy usage or energy efficiency increase or new type of clean energy), then the prediciton might not be accurate, thus we recomment continuing study to improve this prediction model."

In the EDA above, we discovered there are collinearity between `oil_c` and `elec_c`, `oil_g` and `gas_g`. Though it might not affect the predictive power of models, it harms the interpretation of the coefficients of linear models. Collinearity reduction treatment e.g. feature removal, dimension reduction technique, etc., could be considered. Assumed that co2_emission might be still in increasing trend in the future, KNN may not predict well beyond the range of values input in your training data. Other models with similar predictive power which can predict out-of-range input data could be considered."
