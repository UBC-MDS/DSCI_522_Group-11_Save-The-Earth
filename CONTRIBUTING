This outlines how to propose a change to the Save the Earth project.

### Fixing typos

Minor grammatical errors or typos in the documentation can be directly corrected using
the GitHub web interface, but ensure you make the changes in the _source_ file. Please also 
notify team members in the Slack group for any changes made. 

### Prerequisites

Before making a significant pull request, it's important to first raise an issue and
ensure someone from the team acknowledges it as a problem. If you've discovered a
bug, create a related issue and demonstrate the bug with precise language. 

### Pull request procedure

*  It's recommended to create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).  
*  Please summarize the changes you have made in the comments and add group members as reviewers.
